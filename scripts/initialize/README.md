# How to start with Firebun

To start a Firebun project, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -L git.io/fjxEB) project-name
```

_See [the source code of the script on GitHub](https://git.io/fjxMW)_

If you use **Fish**, run this command instead:

```fish
bash -c "bash <(curl -L git.io/fjxEB) project-name"
```

Or you can use [firebun-app as a GitHub repo template](https://git.io/fjxME)
and then run:

```bash
yarn
make start
```

## Settings

During the initialization you'll be asked to answer few questions:

- App name
- Server port
- Staging Firebase project id
- etc
