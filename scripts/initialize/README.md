# How to start with Firebun

To start a Firebun project, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -L git.io/fjxEB) -s project-name
```

_See [the source code of the script on GitHub](https://git.io/fjxMW)_

If you use Fish, run this command instead:

```fish
bash -c "bash <(curl -L git.io/fjxEB) project-name"
```

Or you can use [firebun-app as a GitHub repo template](https://git.io/fjxME)
and then run:

```bash
yarn
make start
```
